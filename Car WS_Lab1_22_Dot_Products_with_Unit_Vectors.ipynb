        "#### **2.**\n",
        "  Now, the best way to make sense of why that's the case, that this DOT product magnitudes larger than these lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "This one is smaller, is thinking about the DOT product formula from the geometric perspective.  So you'll remember that that was like V times, W times the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "So in this first case, we have that these two lengths, the lengths of these two vectors ere both larger than one, so then you multiply them together and you're going to get, you know, whatever the number happens to be.\n",
        "\n",
        "But it's some large number four in these cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are both unit vectors.  So the length of these are one, which means just one times one.  So you can basically just ignore those two terms and you're left with the cosine of the angle between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "And of course, the cosine of an angle is bound between minus one and plus one.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3.** \n",
        "  Now, this concept of computing, the DOT product between two unit vectors, this is related to an analysis that is often used in machine learning and in statistics and machine learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's called cosine similarity in statistics or Peerson correlation coefficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, this term here is not exactly cosine. Similarity is not exactly the Peerson correlation coefficient, but that's only because the correlation coefficient involves another normalization in the denominator. But that's okay.\n",

        "I do want you to appreciate the concept, the point that the DOT product between two normalized vectors is an important quantity tells you about the relationship of those two vectors to each other. And it's a concept or quantity that is used in statistics and in machine learning."
