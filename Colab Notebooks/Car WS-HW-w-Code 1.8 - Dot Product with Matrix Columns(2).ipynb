And in particular, one thing for which we can use computers in mathematics is to help us understand concepts by testing hypotheses: we can come up with an idea and write computer code to create a \"virtual lab\" to test whether the hypothesis seems to be the case or whether it is violated.\n","\n","We call this type of proof empirical proof or soft proof.\n","\n","It's safe to assume that programs like Matlab, Python, Octave or Mathematica, or Maple implement mathematics correctly and accurately. So we trust computers so we can test out different things on the computers and use code as a way to prove a concept or disprove an idea.\n","\n","\n","Empirical proof is not the same as a formal, rigorous mathematical proof.
